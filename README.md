## `k-means++` implementation in `R`

The k-means problem is to find cluster centers that minimize the intra-class variance, i.e. the sum of squared distances from each data point being clustered to its cluster center (the center that is closest to it). Although finding an exact solution to the k-means problem for arbitrary input is NP-hard,[4] the standard approach to finding an approximate solution (often called Lloyd's algorithm or the k-means algorithm) is used widely and frequently finds reasonable solutions quickly.

`k-means++` is an algorithm for choosing the initial values for the k-means clustering algorithm. It was proposed in 2007 by David Arthur and Sergei Vassilvitskii, as an approximation algorithm for the NP-hard k-means problemâ€”a way of avoiding the sometimes poor clusterings found by the standard k-means algorithm.
